								<h3><a href="https://www.igi-global.com/article/a-comparative-study-on-adversarial-noise-generation-for-single-image-classification/243371">A Comparative Study on Adversarial Noise Generation for Single Image Classification</a></h3>
								<h4>IGI Global · Jan 1, 2020</h4>
								<p>With the rise of neural network-based classifiers, it is evident that these algorithms are here to stay. Even though various algorithms have been developed, these classifiers still remain vulnerable to misclassification attacks. This article outlines a new noise layer attack based on adversarial learning and compares the proposed method to other such attacking methodologies like Fast Gradient Sign Method, Jacobian-Based Saliency Map Algorithm and DeepFool. This work deals with comparing these algorithms for the use case of single image classification and provides a detailed analysis of how each algorithm compares to each other.</p>

								<h3><a href="">From Beginning to BEGANing: Role of Adversarial Learning in reshaping Generative models*</a></h3>
								<h4>INS Elsevier (Under Review) · Aug 8, 2021</h4>
								<p>From the birth of Neural Networks, they have been usually trained individually on a particular data set, or have been trained in tandem with other networks which co-train these networks together without much interaction between the two networks. These networks contribute to developing great engineering feats but recent developments in Adversarial Training methodology has shown us that training two networks that compete against yield some better results. This paper aims to look at these results and how it came to be that Adversarial Training dominates the market for synthesis and generative networks.</p>

								<h3><a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-13-1595-4_33">Analysing Image Compression using Generative Adversarial Networks</a></h3>
								<h4>Springer AISC · Jan 10, 2018</h4>
								<p>Most image compression algorithms rely on custom-built encoder–decoder pairs, and they lack flexibility and are differing to the data being compressed. In this paper, we have elaborated on the notion of generative compression by implementing various compression techniques using a generative adversarial network. We have also analysed the compression approaches that are implemented using deep learning. Our experiments are performed on the handwritten digits database and are yielding progressive results with both conditional and quantifiable benchmarks.</p>

								<h3><a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-10-7635-0_22">Understanding how Adversarial Attack affects Single Image Classification</a></h3>
								<h4>Springer CCIS · Dec 1, 2017</h4>
								<p>In recent trends, computer vision applications have seen massive implementation of supervised learning with convolutional neural networks. In this paper, we have analyzed image classifiers and their classification accuracy. Also, we have measured their robustness upon introduction to various noise layers. Furthermore, we have implemented a generative adversarial network for the generator task of adversarial noise generation and the discriminator task of single image classification on the handwritten digits database. Our experiments are yielding progressive results and we have performed conditional and quantifiable evaluation of the generated samples.</p>

								<h3><a href="https://www.ijsr.net/archive/v6i8/ART20176492.pdf">Evaluation of Convolutional architectures for offline handwritten digit recogntion</a></h3>
								<h4>International Journal of Science and Research · Aug 31, 2017</h4>
								<p>Deep learning implementations have resulted in significant performance improvements in several application domains and as such several network architectures have been developed to facilitate their methods. This paper presents a comparative study of two architectures among those which are implemented for handwriting recognition, Highway CNN, and LeNet-5. The evaluation is performed on two separate machines for both CPU(Intel-i5 3250M) and a GPU(Nvidia GTX-1060). We compared them not only on the basis of their accuracy but also their training time, recognition time and their memory requirements. Our experiments demonstrate the advantage of global training and feature mapping on the MNIST dataset. .</p>
